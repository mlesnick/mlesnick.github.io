<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
Calculus is one of the cornerstones of modern human thought and culture.  It plays
a pivotal role in science, engineering, statistics, the social
sciences, and even the arts.  In this era, where computers, machine
learning, and data-driven approaches to problem solving have become 
dominant, calculus is more important than ever.
</br></br>
This course will introduce the fundamentals of caclulus: The main
topics will be limits,
derivatives, and integrals.  If time permits, we may cover
differential equations.  As this is an honors course, there will be more
emphasis on theory and conceptual foundations than in a comparable
non-honors course at SUNY Albany.
</br></br>
<b>Required Course Materials</b>:<br/>
The course textbook is <b> Stewart's Calculus, 8th Edition (Early
Transcendentals). </b>   I recommend 
that you invest in physical copy of the book.
<br /><br />
Students will also be required to use for <a href="http://www.webassign.net/"
target="_blank">WebAssign</a> for homeworks.  The class key is for
this course is <b> albany 3639 0658 </b>.
<br /><br />
There are two recommended options for purchasing access to the text
and to WebAssign:
<ol>
  <li>You can subscribe to Cengage Unlimited for
the semester, which gives you access to WebAssign.  Once you have the
  subscription, renting a physical copy of the text for the semester is inexpensive.</li>
  <li>You can buy a version of the text which comes bundled with
  access to WebAssign.  This is available through the bookstore.</li>
</ol>
<b>Prerequisites</b>:<br/>
Students must be comfortable with standard high school math,
including algebra, trigonometery, analytic geometry, and functions.  
</br></br>
Prior exposure to caclulus is not necessary, but will be helpful.
</br></br>
<b>Expectations</b>:<br/>
The material of this course is challening and requires time, 
patenience, and focus to learn well.  Most students should expect to
spend <b> at least </b> 8-10 hours of <b> focused </b> work per week on the course outside of
class.
</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
25%: Homework and Quizzes <br/>
20%: Midterm I <br/>
20%: Midterm II <br/>
35%: Final
<br/><br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
<b>Homework</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned most weeks.  Unless stated otherwise, it will be due by the start of class on
Friday.  All homeworks will have an online component, to be
completed via WebAssign.  In addition, some homeworks may have a written
component, to be handed in before the start of class.
<br/><br/>
You may discuss the homework with others, but you must complete all of the web assignments
yourself, and you must write up and hand in any written solutions on your
own.  I strongly recommend reading the text before working on the probems, and
working on the problems by yourself before turning to your classmates
for help.
<br/><br/>
No late homework will be accepted, but the two lowest
homework scores will be dropped.
<br/><br/>
<b>Quizzes</b>:<br/>
We may occasionally have quizzes on Wednesdays, based on the homework
of the previous week.
<br/><br/>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html"
target="_blank">SUNY Albany's Undergraduate Academic Regulations</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
The regulations concern academic integrity and 
missing/rescheduling exams, among other things.  Students should also be aware of the <a href="https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml"
target="_blank">University&#39;s Medical Excuse
Policy</a>.

<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
