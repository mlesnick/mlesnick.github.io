<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This is the second course in a three-semester sequence on Topological Data
Analysis (TDA), aimed primarily at students in Albany's Data Science
MS program.  The first two semesters of the sequence emphasize mathematical foundations and conceptual understanding.  
The third course in the sequence is a practicum focusing on hands-on work with real data.
<br /><br />
Topics to be covered (in TDA I and II) may include:
<ul>
  <li>sets and functions</li>
  <li>graphs</li>
  <li>metric spaces</li>
  <li>clustering (with an emphasis on topological approaches)</li>
  <li>complexity of algorithms</li>
  <li>algorithms for graphs and clustering</li>
  <li>Mapper</li>
  <li>simplicial complexes</li>
  <li>persistent homology</li>
  <li>linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction</li> 
  <li>multiparameter persistence</li> 
</ul>
<b>Course Materials</b>:<br/>
Course materials will be hosted on Brightspace.
<br /><br />
The main references for TDA II will be my handwritten notes and "Introduction to Algorithms", 4th edition, by Cormen, Leiserson, Stein, Rivest (CLRS).
Typed notes may also sometimes be provided.

<b>Homework and Quizzes</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned semi-regularly.  In the first part of the class, homeworks will not be handed in.  Instead, we will have a short quiz based on the homework, whose date will be announced with the homework assignment.
<br/><br/>
In the later part of the course, I may stop with the homework-based quizzes and instead have students submit the homework.  In this case, homework submitted at most one day late may be accepted with a 30%
penalty, or at most two days late with a 50% penalty.  
You may discuss homework with your classmates, but homework must be written up 
on your own.
<br/><br/>
If needed to incentivize good attendance, we may also occasionally have short quizzes at the start of class, based on the previous lecture.  These will not be announced in advance.  
</br></br>
All homeworks/quizzes will be worth the same amount.
<br/><br/>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
15%: Homework/Quizzes <br/>
25%: Midterm 1 <br/>
25%: Midterm 2 <br/>
35%: Final <br/>
<br/>
The lowest two HW/quiz scores will be dropped.
<br/>
The midterms and final may be curved, but not downward.
<br/><br/>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity"
target="_blank">the University's Standards of Academic Integrity</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
