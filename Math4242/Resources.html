<H2>Math 4242 Resources</H2>

<H3>Software </H3> 
Computation is at the heart of applications of linear algebra.  This
course will not require you to work with software, but I encourage you to
experiment with computation on your own.  You're welcome to come chat with me
about what you are doing.
</br></br>
<b> Here are some resources for computation: </b>
</br>
<a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/"
target="_blank">Matlab</a> is a simple programming languange and
development environment designed with efficient matrix comptations in
mind.   &nbsp  It is a standard and very convenient option for doing matrix
comptations and for rapid prototyping of computational mathematics
software.  &nbsp Matlab is commercial software.  &nbsp Rick Moeckel, who has taught Math 4242 several times, has written two
"labs" to get you started with linear algebra computations in Matlab, available
<a
href="http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~rmoeckel/course/4242.lab1.txt"
target="_blank">here</a> and
<a
href="http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~rmoeckel/course/4242.lab2.txt"
target="_blank">here</a>.


</br></br>
I am told that
<a
href="https:www.python.org"
target="_blank">Python</a> is a good choice of language for scientific
computing (amongst other things).  &nbsp If you want to try out Python for
scientific computing, I suggest you start <a
href="http://www.scipy.org/"
target="_blank">here</a>.  


Fo some discussion of advantages
of Python over Matlab, see <a
href="http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html"
target="_blank">here</a> and
<a
href="http://phillipmfeldman.org/Python/Advantages_of_Python_Over_Matlab.html"
target="_blank">here</a>.



</br></br>
<a 
href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/"
target="_blank">LAPACK</a> is a standard library for fast, large-scale matrix computations.

<H3> Books </H3>
The Meyer book is very nice, but there are some other nice 
books out there with different advantages.  &nbsp Here are two:
<br/><br/>
<b>Axler, Linear Algebra Done Right</b>.  &nbsp Emphasizes linear transformations and
largely avoids matrices.  &nbsp Math majors and those in interested theory may
enjoy taking a look at this book.
<br/><br/>
<b>Trefethen and Bau, Numerical Linear Algebra</b>.   &nbsp This focuses on
computatation.  &nbsp It is very readable, but is pitched
at a somewhat higher level than Meyer.  &nbsp It'd be a very pleasant read once
you've finished most of this course.
