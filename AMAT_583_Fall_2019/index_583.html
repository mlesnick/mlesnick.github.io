<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This is the first course in two-semester sequence on Topological Data
Analysis (TDA), aimed primarily at students in Albany's Data Science MS program.  
No prior knowledge of topology is assumed.  After a brief introduction to TDA, we will spend the first part of the
semester studying basic concepts in topology needed for TDA, including:
<ul>
  <li>topological spaces,</li>
  <li>homeomorpism, </li>
  <li>homotopy equivalence,</li>
  <li>connectednesss,</li>
  <li>quotient spaces,</li>
  <li>simplicial complexes,</li>
  <li>homology (with field coefficients). </li>
</ul>
As part of our study of homology, we will also devote some time to
studying ideas in abstract linear algebra, especially quotients of
vector spaces.  Later in the semester, we will begin the study of persistent homology, which we
will continue in the second semester.  If time permits, we will discuss
the Mapper algorithm, and connections between persistent homology and
clustering, though these topics might have to wait until the spring.
<br /><br />
<b>Course Materials</b>:<br/>
I plan to post copies of my (handwritten) lecture notes after each
class, usually on the same day as the lecture. 
<br /><br />
The official course text is "Computational Topology" by Edelsbrunner
and Harer.  I will cover parts of this book later in the semester, when we come to persistent homology.  A (free) online 
version with much of the same content as the published version is  
<a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/edelcomp.pdf"
target="_blank">here</a>.
<br /><br />
Other recommended reading:
<ul>
<li> Edelsbrunner and Harer's book does not discuss some basic ideas from
point-set topology that I wish to cover.  For this, a readable resource
is "Introduction to Topology: Pure and Applied" by Adams
and Franzosa.  Another popular text covering point-set topology in more detail is
  "Topology" by Munkres.</li>
<li> For some of the abstract linear algebra that we will be covering, a
nice text is Axler's "Linear Algebra Done Right."</li>
</ul>
Additional resources include:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://geometrica.saclay.inria.fr/team/Steve.Oudot/books/o-pt-fqrtda-15/surv-209.pdf"
target="_blank">The textbook "Persistence Theory: From Quiver Representations to Data
Analysis," by Steve Oudot</a>,</li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/"
target="_blank">The survey "Topology and Data," by
  Gunnar Carlsson</a>,</li>
    <li> <a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0109-5"
target="_blank">The survey "A roadmap for the computation of persistent
  homology," by Nina Otter et al.</a> This provides a brief
  overview of persistent homology, discusses software for
  persistent homology computation, and benchmarks several software
  packages.
  </li> 
</ul>

<b>Homework and Quizzes</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned (semi-)regularly.  In addition, we may
occasionally have quizzes.  Homeworks and quizzes will be weighted
equally.  The lowest two scores among the homework
and quizzes will be dropped.  Homework is to be handed in at the beginning
of class on the day it is due, and this rule will be enforced
strictly.

</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
35%: Homework and quizzes.  <br/>
30%: Midterm <br/>
35%: Final <br/>
2% (bonus): Class participation / engagement.
<br/><br/>
NOTE: The midterm and final may be curved, but not downward.
<br/><br/>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity"
target="_blank">the University's Standards of Academic Integrity</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
