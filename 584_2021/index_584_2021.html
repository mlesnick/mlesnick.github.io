<b>Exam Date </b>:<br/>
Midterm: Wednesday October 13 (tentative).

<br /><br />
<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This is the second course in a three-semester sequence on Topological Data
Analysis (TDA), aimed primarily at students in Albany's Data Science
MS program.

The course picks up where TDA I (as taught in Spring 2021) left off.
Topics will include:

<ul>
  <li>simplicial complexes,</li>
  <li>abstract linear algebra and quotient spaces,</li>
  <li>homology (with field coefficients), </li>
  <li>persistent homology,</li>
  <li>multiparameter persistent homology,</li>
  <li>applications of TDA (time permitting)</li>
</ul>

<b>Prequisites</b>:</br>
Students are formally required to have either taken TDA I (AMAT 583)
or to have 
permission of the instructor.

In addition, it will be helpful for students to be familiar with the following
concepts, which were covered in TDA I in Spring 2021:
<ul>
  <li>metric spaces and topological spaces,</li>
  <li>homeomorphism, </li>
  <li>homotopy equivalence,</li>
  <li>path connectednesss,</li>
  <li>equivalence relations,</li>
  <li>single linkage clustering,</li>
  <li>graphs: connected components and cycles.</li>
</ul>
<!--
These topics will not reviewed minimally or not at all.  If you are
unfamiliar with some of these concepts, you may wish to consider waiting to taking TDA II with Boris Goldfarb when he next
teaches it.

<b>Course Materials</b>:<br/>
I plan to post copies of my (handwritten) lecture notes before each
class, usually on the same day as the lecture. These notes will be the
main reference for the course.
<br /><br />
For some of the abstract linear algebra that we will be covering, a
nice text is Axler's "Linear Algebra Done Right."</li>
<br /><br />
For students wishing to brush up on basic point-set topology, a readable resource
is "Introduction to Topology: Pure and Applied" by Adams
and Franzosa.  Another popular text covering point-set topology in more detail is
  "Topology" by Munkres.

<b>Homework and Quizzes</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned semi-regularly.  In addition, we may
occasionally have quizzes.  Homeworks and quizzes will be weighted
equally.  The lowest two scores among the homework
and quizzes will be dropped.  Homework is to be handed in at the beginning
of class on the day it is due (you will have a 5 minute grace period), and this rule will be enforced
strictly.  Tentatively, homework handed in at most one day late may be accepted with a 30%
penalaty, or at most two days late with a 50% penalty.  You may
discuss homework with your classmates, but homework must be written up 
on your own.


</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
40%: Homework and quizzes.  <br/>
25%: Midterm <br/>
25%: Final Project <br/>
10%: Class participation / engagement.

<br/><br/>
NOTE: The midterm and final may be curved, but not downward.
<br/><br/>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity"
target="_blank">the University's Standards of Academic Integrity</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
<br/><br/>
<b>Pandemic-Related Challenges</b>:<br/>
The pandemic creates a complex and ever-evolving set of difficulties for
students.  I am mindful of this, and I intend to conduct the class accordingly. If
you are dealing with issues created or exacerbated by the pandemic
that risk getting in the way of your being a focused, active
participant in this class, please feel free to discuss your situation
with me.
