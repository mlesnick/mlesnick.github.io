<b>Prerequisites</b>:<br/>
AMAT 214, AMAT 220, and <b>(especially)</b> AMAT 299.  <b>
</br>
IMPORTANT: </b> You cannot take this
course without my permission if you have not passed all of the
prerequisites.
</br></br>
<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This course introduces some of the key ideas of
topology.  Topology studies the properties of geometric objects that are
preserved under "continuous deformations." Informally speaking, continious deformations
include bending, twisting, and stretching of the object, but not
tearing or puncturing.
</br></br>
Topology is one of the major areas of modern mathematics. It is a
beautiful subject in its own right and it plays an important role in other
parts of mathematics, the sciences, and engineering.
</br></br>
Topics may include:
<ul>  
  <li>Continuous functions</li>
  <li>Homeomorphism</li>
  <li>Homotopy</li>
  <li>Isotopy</li>
  <li>Equivalence classes</li>
  <li>Path components</li>
  <li>Metric spaces</li>
  <li>Topological spaces; elements of point-set topology </li>
  <li>Quotient spaces (Gluing)</li>
  <li>Manifolds</li>
  <li>Cell complexes</li>
  <li>Euler Characteristic</li>
  <li>Topological data analysis</li>
</ul>

<b>Course Logistics</b>:</br>
The course will be conducted in a fully in-person
format.  Course materials will be
hosted on Brightspace.
</br></br>
<b>Course Materials</b>:<br/>
There is no required textbook.  I will provide readable handwritten
lecture notes.  These will be the main course reference.  I will also provide concise typed
notes summarizing the main ideas.
<br /><br />
<b>Supplemental Materials (Not Required)</b>:<br/>
For those looking to explore course topics in more depth, there are
many good textbooks on topology, though some are pitched
at a somewhat higher level than this course.  Two standard choices are
"Topology" by Munkres, and "Basic Topology" by Armstrong.
<br /><br />
For those
interested in learning about applications of topology to the sciences,
I recommend "Topological Data Analysis for Genomics and Evolution: Topology in
Biology" by Blumberg and Rábadan.  The first half of the book is
an accessible introduction to applied topology.
<br /><br />
<b>Exams</b>:<br/>
My tentative plan is to have in-class exams on the following days:<br/>
Midterm I: Wednesday, September 27,<br/>
Midterm II: Wednesday, November 1,<br/>
Final: December 11, 3:30 p.m. 
<br /><br />
<b> Exam rules</b>: For each exam, you will be allowed to prepare one page of handwritten notes, front
and back, to use during the exam.  During the exam, no use of any other
materials (including the internet, phone, etc.) will be allowed.
</br></br>
<b>Homework</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned semi-regularly.  In addition, we may
occasionally have quizzes.  Homeworks and quizzes will be weighted
equally.  The lowest two scores among the homework
and quizzes will be dropped.  Tentatively, homework handed in at most one day late may be accepted with a 30%
penalty, or at most two days late with a 50% penalty.  You may
discuss homework with your classmates, but homework must be written up 
on your own.  
</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
25%: Homework/Quizzes <br/>
20%: Midterm I <br/>
20%: Midterm II <br/>
30%: Final <br/>
5%: Class engagement/effort. 
<br/><br/>
Each homework will be weighted equally.  The lowest two homework scores will be dropped.  The midterm and final may be curved, but not downward.
<br><br/>
The engagement/effort score will take into account attendance, participation in class, and participation in office
hours.  Students do not need to engage in all of these ways to
have a high engagement/effort score, but should
actively engage through some of these
avenues.
<br/><br/>
<b>Expectations</b>:<br/>
Topology is a fun and fascinating subject, but it is also a challenging one.  The
material is inherently very abstract, and it takes time and careful
thought to become comfortable with the ideas.  As a first exposure to
topology, this class tries to introduce the ideas in a gentle,
friendly way.  Still, most students will find the material to be challenging,
and to have a good experience in this class, they will need to put in substantial work.
<b> As a rough estimate, I expect students to put in
at least 7-10 hours of work per week on this course, aside from time
spent in class.</b>  This time should be spent reading the notes,
doing homework, visiting office hours, discussing the material with your classmates,
and thinking about the material on your own.
<br/><br/>
<!---
<b>Pandemic-Related Challenges</b>:<br/>
The pandemic creates a complex and ever-evolving set of difficulties for
students.  I am mindful of this. If
you are dealing with issues created or exacerbated by the pandemic
that risk getting in the way of your being a focused, active
participant in this class, I encourage you to discuss this with me.

<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html"
target="_blank">SUNY Albany's Undergraduate Academic Regulations</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
The regulations concern academic integrity and 
missing/rescheduling exams, among other things.  Students should also be aware of the <a href="https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml"
target="_blank">University&#39;s Medical Excuse
Policy</a>.
<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
<br/><br/>
<b>Cheating</b>: Cases of cheating are a major headache for an instructor, typically creating hours of extra
work.  It is often a lot easier to
detect cheating than students realize.  If you are caught cheating, your grade will pay a heavy
price, and it is possibile that you will fail the course.
Cheating may also be reported to the university, as described in
the Academic Regulations.
