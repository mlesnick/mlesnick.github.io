<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
Linear algebra is <b/> everywhere </b> in modern science, mathematics,
statistics, and engineering. &nbsp  A solid knowledge of the subject
is essential for doing serious work in most quantitative fields.
</br></br>
The main goal of this course is to help students develop a strong
theoretical foundation in linear algebra.  &nbsp
Though our focus will be on fundamentals, we will also discuss some applications and touch on computational questions.
</br></br>

<b>Prerequisites</b>:<br/>
Students should already have had some exposure 
linear algebra at the level of MATH 2373 or MATH 2243.  &nbsp We will
review the basics, but will quickly move on to new things. 
</br></br>
<b>Required Textbook</b>:<br/>
<b> Meyer, Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra. </b> &nbsp  We will
cover most of chapters 1-7.   &nbsp  <a

<br /><br />
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
75%: Three midterm exams (25% each)<br/>
25%: Weekly quizzes. &nbsp Lowest 2 quiz scores will
be dropped.
<br/><br/>
<b>Homework</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned each week but not collected.  &nbsp
Instead, the weekly quizzes will consist of problems very similar to the homework problems. &nbsp
If you can do the homework problems, you should have no trouble with the quizzes.
