<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This course is intended primarily for students in Albany's Data Science
MS program in their second year.  It may also be suitable for some
first-year students with a strong background in math, and for math
Ph.D. students interested in computation.  There are no formal
prerequisites, but mathematical maturity and comfort with proofs is required.
<br /><br />
Students are expected to attend and participate.  Course
materials will be hosted on Blackboard.
<br /><br />
The course will cover general background on
algorithms, with an emphasis on topics of interest to data
scientists.  For some of the material, I will follow parts of the text "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen,
Leiserson,  Rivest, Stein.
<br /><br />
Towards the end of the course, we will take a close look at a few 
algorithms of particular interest in data science.  This part will
center around individual student
projects, where students learn independently about a fundamental
algorithm and its applications in data
science.  Each project will culminate in a presentation to the class
(20-30 minutes).
<br /><br />
Possible topics (either for my lectures or for student projects) include:
<ul>
  <li>asymptotic complexity</li>
  <li>basic data structures and algorithms (e.g. sorting, binary search trees, priority queues)</li>
  <li>graph algorithms (e.g., breadth/depth-first search, shortest
  paths, MST, matching)</li>
  <li>NP-completeness</li>
  <li>floating point arithmetic and condition numbers</li>
  <!--<li>Computation of eigenvalues and SVD, applications to
  dimensionality reduction</li>-->
  <!--<li>Pagerank</li>-->
  <li>Union-find, applications to clustering</li>
  <li>Delaunay triangulations, applications to TDA</li>
  <li>Assignment problems</li>
  <!--<li>linear programming</li>
  <li>semi-definite programming</li>--> 
  <li> Dynamic programming, applications to sequence alignment</li>
  <li>Spectral clustering</li>
  <li>Auctions</li> 
  <li>approximation algorithms</li>
  <li>randomized algorithms</li>
  <li>Decidability</li>
</ul>
The course will emphasize the mathematical thinking behind algorithms,
and not implementations/coding.  There will be no required coding
assignments, though final projects can potentially involve implementation work and computational experiments.
<br /><br />
The material covered in this course will be challenging (more so than
my TDA I and II courses) and students
should expect to put in substantial effort outside of lecture.
<br /><br />

</ul>

<b>Midterm</b>:<br/>
We'll have an in-class (Zoom) midterm, tentatively on Thursday, March 24.
<br /><br />
<b>Homework and Quizzes</b> (tentative):<br/>
Homework will be assigned semi-regularly.  The lowest homework
score will be dropped.  Homework is to be handed in at the beginning
of class on the day it is due (you will have a 5 minute grace period), and this rule will be enforced
strictly.  Homework handed in at most one day late may be accepted with a 30%
penalty, or at most two days late with a 50% penalty.  You may
discuss homework with your classmates, but homework must be written up 
on your own.
<br /><br />
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
30%: Homework <br/>
30%: Midterm <br/>
30%: Final Presentation <br/>
10%: Class participation and engagement
<br/><br/>
NOTE: The midterm may be curved, but not downward.
<br/><br/>
<b>Pandemic-Related Challenges</b>:<br/>
The pandemic creates a complex set of potential difficulties for
students. I intend to hold this class to a high standard of effort,
but at the same time, I am mindful of the unique challenges our
situation presents, and I intend to conduct the class accordingly. If
you are dealing with issues created or exacerbated by the pandemic
that risk getting in the way of your being a focused, active
participant in this class, please let me know. 
<br /><br />

<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity"
target="_blank">the University's Standards of Academic Integrity</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these. <br
