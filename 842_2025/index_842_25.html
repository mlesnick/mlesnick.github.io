<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This is a Ph.D. level course on persistent homology, the main technical tool of topological data analysis.  The focus of the course will be on mathematical foundations.  I have taught a similar course twice before; the second time was a two-semester version focusing on multiparameter persistence.  During these previous iterations, I prepared and refined a set of typed course notes, which we will also follow this semester.  In a single semester, will only be able to cover part of the notes, and so there will necessarily be less emphasis on multi-parameter persistence, but I will cover as much multiparameter material as possible.
</br></br>
Here is a list of possible topics:
<ul>
  <li> Fundamentals of 1-parameter persistence: Filtrations on point cloud and metric data, the structure theorem for persistence modules, the persistence algorithm</li>  
  <li> Interleavings and stability theory </li>
  <li> Construction of multiparameter filtrations from data </li>
  <li> The difficulty of defining (unsigned) barcodes in the multiparameter setting </li>
  <li> Elements of quiver representation theory</li>
  <li> Signed barcodes</li>
  <li> Minimal presentations/resolutions and their computation</li>
  <li> Computable metrics on multiparameter persistence modules </li>
  <li> Computation of density-sensitive bifiltrations </li>
   <li> Visualization of 2-parameter persistent homology </li>
  <li> Vectorization of persistence modules </li>
  <li> Applications </li>
  </ul>
<b>Course Materials</b>:<br/>
The main course text will be my typed notes (see the link above). &nbsp;  the notes draw in part on some material from my recent article with Magnus Botnan, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14289?context=math"
target="_blank"> "An Introduction to Multiparameter Persistence," </a> which may also be a helpful resource.

</br></br>
<b>Prerequisites</b>:<br/>
This course requires familiarity 
with homology theory and the basics of abstract algebra (groups,
rings), or willingness to learn aspects of this quickly. &nbsp;  General mathematical maturity, at the usual level of Ph.D. coursework in mathematics at UAlbany, is also required. &nbsp;
Prior exposure to TDA is not required, but would be helpful.
</br></br>
<b>Grading and Coursework</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme. 
</br></br>
To get a B in this course, it will suffice to attend class (in person) regularly. &nbsp; Two lectures can be missed without penalty.  There will also be assigned readings from the course notes.  For a grade higher than a B, students will be required to do homework (including one brief presentation on a TDA application), and to take a midterm and final.  
</br></br>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity"
target="_blank">the University's Standards of Academic Integrity</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
