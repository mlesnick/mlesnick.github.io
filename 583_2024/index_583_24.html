<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This is the first course in a three-semester sequence on Topological Data
Analysis (TDA), aimed primarily at students in Albany's Data Science
MS program.  No prior knowledge of topology is assumed.
The first two semesters of the sequence will emphasize mathematical foundations and conceptual understanding.  
The third course in the sequence is a practicum focusing on hands-on work with real data.
<br /><br />
Topics to be covered (in this course and in TDA II) may include:
<ul>
  <li>sets and functions</li>
  <li>graphs</li>
  <li>metric spaces</li>
  <li>clustering (with an emphasis on topological approaches)</li>
  <li>complexity of algorithms</li>
  <li>algorithms for graphs and clustering</li>
  <li>Mapper</li>
  <li>simplicial complexes</li>
  <li>persistent homology</li>
  <li>linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction</li> 
  <li>multiparameter persistence</li> 
</ul>
<b>Course Materials</b>:<br/>
Course materials will be hosted on Brightspace.
<br/><br />
The primary course reference is a set of typed course notes.

<b>Homework</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned semi-regularly.  All homeworks will be weighted equally.  Homework handed in at most one day late may be accepted with a 30%
penalty, or at most two days late with a 50% penalty.  You may
discuss homework with your classmates, but homework must be written up 
on your own.

<b>Quizzes</b>:<br/>
We will occasionally have short quizzes at the start of class, based on the previous lecture.  These will not be announced in advance.

</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
10%: Homework <br/>
5%: Homework <br/>
25%: Midterm 1 <br/>
25%: Midterm 2 <br/>
35%: Final <br/>
<br/>
The lowest HW score will be dropped.
<br/>
NOTE: The midterm and final may be curved, but not downward.
<br/><br/>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity"
target="_blank">the University's Standards of Academic Integrity</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
