<b>Exam Dates </b>:<br/>
Midterm I: Thursday October 10 (tentative),<br/>
Midterm II: Tue, November 12 (tentative),<br/>
Final: Tues. Dec 17th, 8:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m.
<br /><br />

<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This course will introduce some of the key ideas of
topology.  Topology studies the properties of geometric objects that are
preserved under "continuous deformations." Informally speaking, continous deformations
include bending, twisting, and stretching of the object, but not
tearing or puncturing.
</br></br>
Topology is one of the major areas of modern mathematics. It is a
beautiful subject in its own right and it plays an important role in other
parts of mathematics, the sciences, and engineering.
</br></br>

<b>Course Textbook</b>:<br/>
The required textbook is "Topology of Surfaces, Knots, and Manifolds"
<b> by Stephan C. Carlson.</b>  I might also assign other readings
throughout the course; for these, I will provide handouts or links to
online material.
<br /><br />
I plan to post copies of my (handwritten) lecture notes after each
class, usually on the same day as the lecture. 
<br /><br />

<b>Prerequisites</b>:<br/>
AMAT 214, AMAT 220, and AMAT 299.
</br></br>
<b>Homework and Quizzes</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned reguarly.  You may discuss the homework with others, but you must complete all of the assignments
yourself.  In addition, we may
occasionally have quizzes.

</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
25%: Homework and Quizzes <br/>
20%: Midterm I <br/>
20%: Midterm II <br/>
35%: Final <br/>
2% (bonus): Class participation / engagement. 
<br/><br/>
Each homework and quiz will be weighted equally, and the lowest two
homework/quiz scores will be dropped.
<br/><br/>
NOTE: The midterm and final may be curved, but not downward.
<br/><br/>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html"
target="_blank">SUNY Albany's Undergraduate Academic Regulations</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
The regulations concern academic integrity and 
missing/rescheduling exams, among other things.  Students should also be aware of the <a href="https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml"
target="_blank">University&#39;s Medical Excuse
Policy</a>.

<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
