<b>Exam Dates </b>:<br/>
Midterm I: Wed. Feb. 27,<br/>
Midterm II: Wed. April. 3 (tentative),<br/>
Final: Sat. May 11 (10:30-12:30).
<br /><br />
<b>Required Course Materials</b>:<br/>
The course textbook is <b> Stewart's Calculus, 8th Edition (Early
Transcendentals). </b>   I recommend 
that you invest in physical copy of the book.
<br /><br />
Students will also be required to use <a href="http://www.webassign.net/"
target="_blank">WebAssign</a> for homeworks.  The class key is for
this course is <b> albany 0607 8230</b>.
<br /><br />
There are two recommended options for purchasing access to the text
and to WebAssign:
<ol>
  <li>You can subscribe to Cengage Unlimited for
the semester, which gives you access to WebAssign.  Once you have the
  subscription, renting a physical copy of the text for the semester is inexpensive.</li>
  <li>You can buy a version of the text which comes bundled with
  access to WebAssign.  This is available through the bookstore.</li>
</ol>
<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
Calculus is one of the cornerstones of modern human thought and culture.  It plays
a pivotal role in science, engineering, statistics, the social
sciences, and even the arts.  In this era, where computers, machine
learning, and data-driven approaches to problem solving have become 
dominant, calculus is more important than ever.
</br></br>
This course will introduce fundamentals of caclulus, continuing
where AMAT/TMAT 118 left off.  We will follow the required text
closely, covering material from chapters 5-11.  As this is an honors course, there will be more
emphasis on theory and conceptual foundations than in a comparable
non-honors course at SUNY Albany.
</br></br>


<b>Prerequisites</b>:<br/>
AMAT 118, a grade of A in AMAT 112, or permission of instructor.  
</br></br>
<b>Expectations</b>:<br/>
The material of this course is challening and requires time, 
patenience, and focus to learn well.  Most students should expect to
spend <b> at least </b> 8-10 hours of <b> focused </b> work per week on the course outside of
class.  You are expected to read the relevant parts of the text before
doing the problems sets. 

</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
25%: Homework and Quizzes <br/>
20%: Midterm I <br/>
20%: Midterm II <br/>
35%: Final
<br/><br/>
Each homework and quiz will be weighted equally, and the lowest two
homework/quiz scores will be dropped.
<br/><br/>
<b>Homework</b>:<br/>
WebAssign homework will be assigned most weeks.  Unless stated otherwise, it will be due by the start of class on
Friday.
<br/><br/>
You may discuss the homework with others, but you must complete all of the assignments
yourself.  I strongly recommend working on the problems by yourself before turning to your classmates for help.
<br/><br/>
<b>Quizzes</b>:<br/>
We may occasionally have quizzes, based on the homework
of the previous week.
<br/><br/>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html"
target="_blank">SUNY Albany's Undergraduate Academic Regulations</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
The regulations concern academic integrity and 
missing/rescheduling exams, among other things.  Students should also be aware of the <a href="https://www.albany.edu/health_center/medicalexcuse.shtml"
target="_blank">University&#39;s Medical Excuse
Policy</a>.

<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
