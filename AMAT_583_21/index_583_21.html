Final: Wednesday May 12, 3:30 - 5:30.

<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This is the first course in a two-semester sequence on Topological Data
Analysis (TDA), aimed primarily at students in Albany's Data Science
MS program.  No prior knowledge of topology is assumed.

This is an <b>online-synchonous course</b>, taught on Zoom.  Students are expected to attend and partipate, to the extent
possible.  Recordings of all live classes will be made avaialble.
Course materials, including Zoom links for class and office hours, will be hosted on Blackboard.
<br /><br />
Topics to be covered (in this course and in TDA II) include:
<ul>
  <li>topological spaces</li>
  <li>homeomorpism </li>
  <li>homotopy equivalence</li>
  <li>path connectednesss</li>
  <li>metric spaces</li>
  <li>graphs and simplicial complexes</li>
  <li>abstract linear algebra (in particular, quotient vector spaces)</li>
  <li>homology (with field coefficients) </li>
  <li>topological approaches to clustering</li>
  <li>persistent homology (definition, computation, stability, applications)</li>
  <li>mapper</li>
  <li>multiparameter persistent homology</li>  
</ul>
<b>Course Materials</b>:<br/>
I plan to post copies of my handwritten lecture notes before each
class.  These and the course
videos are the primary course materials.  I may also sometimes provide typed notes.

<b>Homework and Quizzes</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned semi-regularly.  In addition, we may
occasionally have quizzes.  Homeworks and quizzes will be weighted
equally.  The lowest two scores among the homework
and quizzes will be dropped.  Homework is to be handed in at the beginning
of class on the day it is due (you will have a 5 minute grace period), and this rule will be enforced
strictly.  Homework handed in at most one day late may be accepted with a 30%
penalaty, or at most two days late with a 50% penalty.  You may
discuss homework with your classmates, but homework must be written up 
on your own.


</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
45%: Homework and quizzes.  <br/>
20%: Midterm <br/>
25%: Final <br/>
10%: Class participation / engagement.
<br/><br/>
NOTE: The midterm and final may be curved, but not downward.
<br/><br/>
<b>Pandemic-Related Challenges</b>:<br/>
The pandemic--and the move to online instruction in
particular--creates a complex set of potential difficulties for
students. I intend to hold this class to a high standard of effort,
but at the same time, I am mindful of the unique challenges our
situation presents, and I intend to conduct the class accordingly. If
you are dealing with issues created or exacerbated by the pandemic
that risk getting in the way of your being a focused, active
participant in this class, please let me know. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity"
target="_blank">the University's Standards of Academic Integrity</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
