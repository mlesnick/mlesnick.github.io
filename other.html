<h3> Music </h3>
A while ago, I made some "computer music."  &nbsp;

(in 2006-2009, mostly).  &nbsp; I was intensely interested in this,
but I never took it as far as I wanted
to.  &nbsp;

<h3> A Game </h3>

  href="http://www.albany.edu/~ML644186/documents/Nails_Instructions.pdf">Here
  are the rules to "Nails"</a>, a card game I designed in 2010.&nbsp;
  It's a very simple SET-like game with a dynamic similar to the
  children's card game War.&nbsp; </span>The game is played with a
  custom deck of 48 round cards.  The goal is to decide quickly
  whether a pair of cards is distance two apart in a certain metric;
for a randomly chosen pair of cards, the probability of this is quite
close to 1/2.

  can </span>download a PDF file of the cards here</a>, print them on
  cardstock (8 color pages), and cut them out.&nbsp;
