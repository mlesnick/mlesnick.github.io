<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This is the second course in a three-semester sequence on Topological Data
Analysis (TDA), aimed primarily at students in Albany's Data Science
MS program.  As I teach it, the first two semesters of the TDA sequence emphasize mathematical foundations and conceptual understanding.  
The third course in the sequence is a practicum focusing on hands-on work with real data.
<br /><br />
This course is a continuation of my TDA I (AMAT 583) course from Fall '22, and will build on material covered in that course.  If you have taken AMAT 583 with Boris, I strongly recommend (in most cases) that you also take TDA II with him, as we organize our courses differently.
<br /><br />
Topics to be covered (either in TDA I or TDA II) may include:
<ul>
  <li>topological spaces</li>
  <li>metric spaces</li>
  <li>homeomorphism </li>
  <li>homotopy equivalence</li>
  <li>path connectedness</li>
  <li>clustering (with an emphasis on topological approaches)</li>
  <li>graphs and simplicial complexes</li>
  <li>persistent homology (definition, computation, stability, applications)</li>
  <li>Mapper</li>
  <li>multiparameter persistence</li> 
  <li>linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction</li> 
</ul>
<b>Course Materials</b>:<br/>
Course materials will be hosted on Blackboard.
<br/><br />
I plan to post copies of my handwritten lecture notes before each
class.  These are the primary course materials.  As a secondary resource, I may also sometimes provide typed notes.

<b>Homework and Quizzes</b>:<br/>
Homework will be assigned semi-regularly.  In addition, we might
occasionally have quizzes.  Homeworks and quizzes will be weighted
equally.  The lowest score among the homework
and quizzes will be dropped.  Homework is to be handed precisely by the time it is due (you will have a 5 minute grace period), and this rule will be enforced
strictly.  Homework handed in at most one day late may be accepted with a 30%
penalty, or at most two days late with a 50% penalty.  You may
discuss homework with your classmates, but homework must be written up 
on your own.


</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme.
<br/><br/>
20%: Homework and quizzes.  <br/>
30%: Midterm <br/>
40%: Final <br/>
10%: Class participation / engagement.
<br/><br/>
NOTE: The midterm and final may be curved, but not downward.
<br/><br/>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity"
target="_blank">the University's Standards of Academic Integrity</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
<br/><br/>
There will be no leeway on missed exams or last-minute exam
rescheduling, except as noted in the regulations.  If you anticipate an issue with
the timing of an exam, please let me know as soon as possible.
