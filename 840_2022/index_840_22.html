<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
This course is a two-semester sequence on multiparameter persistent
homology (MPH), an exciting and very active subfield of TDA with a rich theory and great promise for practical applications. &nbsp; In this course, we will study both the theoretical and computational sides of MPH, with an emphasis on aspects most relevant to the development of MPH as a practical data analysis tool.
</br></br>
The course will be taught in a hybrid format: There will be live lectures at UAlbany, and these will be broadcast via Zoom. &nbsp; The lectures will be recorded and asynchronous participation is possible. &nbsp; Students from outside of UAlbany are welcome to participate in the course remotely. &nbsp; UAlbany students with no scheduling conflict are expected to attend the course in person.
</br></br>

Here is a tentative list of topics (for both semesters):
<ul>
  <li> Fundamentals of 1-parameter persistent homology, including the persistence algorithm and algebraic stability</li>  
  <li> Construction of multiparameter filtrations from data </li>
  <li> The difficulty of defining (unsigned) barcodes for MPH </li>
  <li> Elements of quiver representation theory</li>
  <li> Signed barcodes</li>
  <li> Interleavings and stability theory </li>
  <li> Minimal presentations/resolutions and their computation</li>
  <li> Computable metrics on multiparameter persistence modules </li>
  <li> Computation of density-sensitive bifiltrations </li>
  <li> Upset presentations and the bipersistence of smooth functions</li>
  <li> Sheaf-theoretic viewpoints on generalized persistence </li>
  <li> Visualization of 2-parameter persistent homology </li>
  <li> Vectorization of persistence modules </li>
  <li> Applications </li>
  </ul>
<b>Course Materials</b>:<br/>
The main resource for the course will be a set of typed notes (see the link above). &nbsp; These will be a revised and expanded version of my <a href="https://www.albany.edu/~ML644186/AMAT_840_Spring_2019/Math840_Notes.pdf"
target="_blank">notes</a> from a previous (1-semester) version of this course.  &nbsp;
The updated notes will draw on material from my recent article with Magnus Botnan, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14289?context=math"
target="_blank"> "An Introduction to Multiparameter Persistence." </a>

</br></br>
<b>Prerequisites</b>:<br/>
Instructor permission is required. &nbsp;  This course requires familiarity 
with homology theory and the basics of abstract algebra (groups,
rings). &nbsp;  General mathematical maturity, at the usual level of Ph.D. coursework in mathematics at UAlbany, is also required. &nbsp;
Prior exposure to TDA is not required, but would be helpful.
</br></br>
<b>Grading and Coursework</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's A-E grading scheme. 
</br></br>
To get a B in this course, it will suffice to attend class (in person) regularly. &nbsp; Two lectures can be missed without penalty.  For a grade higher than a B, students will be required to do homework, take a midterm (both fall and spring), and complete a final project (spring).
</br></br>
Students not officially registered for the course will not receive a course grade, but can submit homework and take the exams, if they wish. &nbsp; remote students are encouraged to complete a final project in the spring.
</br></br>
<b>Academic Regulations</b>:<br/>
Naturally, <a href="https://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity"
target="_blank">the University's Standards of Academic Integrity</a> apply to
this course, and students are expected to be familiar with these.
