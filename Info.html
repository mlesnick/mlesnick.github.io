<h1>Mike + Mini's Wedding Celebration </h1>
<img src="https://www.albany.edu/~ML644186/std4.jpg" alt="Mike and Mini" style="width:658px;height:370px;">

<p>Hello and Annyung hasseo.  We are excited to see you in a few weeks.</p>

<h2>Event Details</h2>
<p>The festivities will begin at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday the 15th of April, at </p>

<p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://thereceptionhouse.com/">The Reception House</a>, 
167-17 Northern Blvd, Flushing, NY 11358, 
Phone: (917) 889-4459
</p>

<p>Free parking is available next to the venue.  The entrance to the lot is on the north side of Northern Boulevard, between 168th and 169th street.  In the unlikely event that this lot is full, it should be very easy to find free street parking nearby. </p>

<p> By Train from Manhattan: Take the Port Washington LIRR train from Penn Station to Broadway Station.  Walk south on 164th St. toward Station Rd.
Turn left onto Northern Blvd.  The venue is located
on your left. </p>

<h2>Hotels Etc.</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a hotel near the venue, there are a number of hotels near the Main St. 7 station in Flushing.  The hotels in this area will be less ~1.8 miles from the venue; a short cab ride / bus ride away, or a ~35 minute walk.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, there are zillions of places to stay throughout the city, and though Flushing has some great food, you might prefer to stay somewhere more centrally located, if you plan to explore NYC while you are in town.  It is easy to get between the west side of Manhattan and Flushing via LIRR @ Penn Station.  Airbnb may be a good option.  Please let us know if you have any questions about accommodations or want some suggestions about neighborhoods, etc.
</p>

<h2>Dress</h2>
<p> ...to impress.  Usual wedding reception attire will work well.  If you want to go with something a bit more fun, that's cool too.  </p>

<h2>Registry Etc.</h2>
<p>A number of our friends asked us about a wedding registry.  We'll be moving from Princeton to Albany, NY in about 16 months.  In the meantime, we don't have much need for the usual wedding registry stuff.  Instead, for those that wish to give us a gift, we suggest either of the following two options:</p>

<p>
1. A donation on our behalf to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/donate.aspx?IsGift=3">Against Malaria Foundation</a>.  Among the many amazing global health charities out there, we suggest this one because it has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.givewell.org/charities/against-malaria-foundation">good reputation</a> for cost-effectiveness and transparency.
</p>

2. In a nod to the tradition of cash gifts at Korean weddings, we have created a 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.zola.com/registry/myml">future furniture + kitchenware gift fund</a>, 
to be used after we leave Princeton and are more permanently settled.  "Furniture" may include a decent used piano, if we can find one.  (Full disclosure: The website takes a 2.5% cut.)
