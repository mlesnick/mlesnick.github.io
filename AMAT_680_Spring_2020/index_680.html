<b>About this Course</b>:</br>
The main goal of this course is to provide students with experience doing
independent research and presenting mathematics to a live audience.
</br></br>
Each student will give two 30-40 minute expository presentations
during the semester.  These can be done either be blackboard talks or
computer talks.  Computer talks are encouraged.
</br></br>
Each presentation will be on a topic outside of the standard
undergraduate/masters level curriculum for mathematics majors.
(Suggestions are below.)  The level of the talk should be appropriate
for beginning graduate students and challenging for a typical senior
pursuing a degree in mathematics.
</br></br>
The suggested (broad) theme for the seminar talks is computational
mathematics.  Ideally, every talk should mention least one theorem
and one algorithm.
</br></br>
For each presentation, the student will spend substantial time
researching the topic and preparing notes/slides.  Topics of
presentations will be chosen by the student with the input of the instructor.  We will coordinate to ensure that
no topic is covered by more than one student.
</br></br>
There may also be shorter, less formal assignments
intended to help students prepare for the main presentations.  Software for
making mathematics presentations on a computer (in particular, the
typesetting language LaTex) will be introduced as needed.  
</br></br>
Most presentations will be on Mondays.  Most (but not all) Wednesday class periods
will be devoted to individual meetings with students about their
presentations.

<b>Prequisites</b>:</br>
The prerequisite for this class is good standing in the graduate
program.

</br></br>
<b>Grading</b>:<br/>
The class will use the university's S/U grading scheme. For a
satisfactory grade, the student will have to: sucessfully give both of the
presentations, putting in a substantial effort to prepare for each;
participate actively in after-talk discussions; and complete any other
assigned work.  Attendance is
required, and is very important in a class of this size; students who miss more than two classes without advance
permission from the instructor are at risk for a grade of U.
